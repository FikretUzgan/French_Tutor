## 🔥 "Strict Teacher" Personality Guidelines

```
"Ödevini teslim etmedin! Bir sonraki derse geçemezsin. 
Önce ödevini yap, sonra devam ederiz."
```

**Exam Failed:**
```
"Maalesef sınavdan geçemedin. Genel notun %[score] ama şu konularda 
yetersizsin: [weak_topics]. Önce bunları halledelim."
```

**Exam Passed (70-80%):**
```
"Geçtin, ama zorlukla. Daha çok çalışman lazım. 
Özellikle şu konularda: [needs_improvement]"
```

**Exam Passed (80-90%):**
```
"İyi! Çalışman karşılığını veriyor. Böyle devam et."
```

**Exam Passed (90%+):**
```
"Mükemmel! Sen bu işin hakkını veriyorsun. Aferin!"
```

**Streak Broken (3+ days no study):**
```
"3 gündür ders yapmıyorsun! Bu ne perhiz, bu ne lahana turşusu? 
Disiplinsizlik! Hemen derse başla."
```

**7-Day Streak Achieved:**
```
"Tebrikler! 7 günlük seriyi tamamladın. Düzenli çalışıyorsun."
```

**Level Transition:**
```
"Aferin! {old_level} seviyesini tamamladın. 
Artık {new_level} öğrencisisin. Hazır mısın?"
```

## 🎯 Grammar Topic Selection by Week

### Progression Principles:
1. **Simple → Complex:** Basic verb forms before advanced tenses
2. **High frequency → Low frequency:** Common structures first
3. **Building blocks:** Each topic builds on previous weeks
4. **Recycling:** Review previous grammar in examples continuously

### Grammar Coverage Checklist:

**A1 (Weeks 1-9):**
- [ ] Être/Avoir
- [ ] Regular -er, -ir, -re verbs
- [ ] Articles (definite, indefinite, partitive)
- [ ] Possessive/demonstrative adjectives
- [ ] Basic negation (ne...pas)
- [ ] Question formation (3 types)
- [ ] Passé composé (avoir)
- [ ] Passé composé (être + agreement)
- [ ] Futur proche
- [ ] Impératif

**A2 (Weeks 10-18):**
- [ ] Imparfait
- [ ] Imparfait vs Passé Composé
- [ ] Futur simple
- [ ] Conditional present
- [ ] Object pronouns (direct, indirect)
- [ ] Pronouns Y and EN
- [ ] Relative pronouns (qui, que, où)
- [ ] Reflexive verbs
- [ ] Comparatives/superlatives

**B1 (Weeks 19-27):**
- [ ] Subjonctif (introduction, common triggers)
- [ ] Plus-que-parfait
- [ ] Passive voice
- [ ] Complex sentences (multiple clauses)
- [ ] Indirect speech
- [ ] Literary tenses (passé simple - reading recognition)

**B2 (Weeks 28-36):**
- [ ] Advanced subjonctif usage
- [ ] Gérondif and participle clauses
- [ ] All tense review with nuances
- [ ] Register shifts (formal vs informal)
- [ ] Discourse markers and connectors
- [ ] Idiomatic expressions

## 📐 English Comparison Requirement

**CRITICAL:** Every grammar explanation MUST include comparison with English.

### Format:
```markdown
English comparison:
[Explain how French grammar differs from English]
[Why this is tricky for English speakers]
[Memory aid or pattern recognition tip]
```

### Example:
```markdown
English comparison:
English: I am 25 years old. (use "to be")
French: J'ai 25 ans. (use "to have" - literally "I have 25 years")

This is because French treats age as a possession, not a state of being.
Remember: Age = avoir, Profession/Nationality = être
```

---

## 🎲 Question Variety in Exams

### Question Type Distribution (Weekly Exams):

**Grammar Section (10 questions):**
- 1 full conjugation paradigm

## 🔄 Dynamic Content Generation

### Ensuring Non-Repetition:

**Exams:**
- Each attempt generates ENTIRELY new questions
- Same grammar topic, different verbs/contexts
- Vocabulary tested in different sentence contexts
- Reading passages on similar themes but different content

**Example:**
```
Attempt 1: Conjugate "parler" → Je parle, tu parles...
Attempt 2: Conjugate "habiter" → J'habite, tu habites...
Attempt 3: Conjugate "aimer" → J'aime, tu aimes...
```

**Homework:**
- Prompts vary even for same exercise type
- Personalization encouraged (write about YOUR family, not generic)
