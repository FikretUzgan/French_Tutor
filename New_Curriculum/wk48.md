### Scaffolding Steps

**DELF B2 / Formal Exam Preparation:**

**1. DELF B2 EXAM STRUCTURE:**

```

- 5-minute discussion/interview
- Rate: 25 points

TOTAL: 100 points (50 to pass)
```

**2. TEST-TAKING STRATEGY:**

```
TIME MANAGEMENT:
- Read all questions first (time plan: comprehension 5 min, answer 25 min)
- In written: Outline first (5 min), write (40 min), revise (15 min)
- In oral: Prepare during prep time, don't panic with unfamiliar vocabulary

COMPREHENSION STRATEGIES:
- Don't try to understand EVERY word
- Focus on main ideas and supporting details
- Use context and cognates
- For listening: take notes on key points, fill in later

WRITING STRATEGIES:
- Essays must have clear structure (intro, body x2, conclusion)
- Use sophisticated vocabulary intentionally
- Write legibly (clarity matters)
- Leave time to proofread grammar

SPEAKING STRATEGIES:
- Speak clearly and at natural pace
- Don't rush - pauses are acceptable
- If you don't understand, ask: "Pourriez-vous reformuler?"
- Give full answers to show range
- Use subjunctive and advanced structures naturally
```

**3. COMMON WEAK AREAS TO PRACTICE:**

```
COMPREHENSION:
- Understanding speakers at natural speed
- Distinguishing between similar-sounding words
- Inferring meaning from context

WRITING:
- Grammatical agreement and tense consistency
- Organization and paragraph coherence
- Spelling of frequent words

SPEAKING:
- Pronunciation and intonation
- Self-correction without losing flow
- Maintaining conversation under pressure
```

**4. ANXIETY MANAGEMENT:**

```
BEFORE EXAM:
- Practice extensively with timed mock exams
- Get adequate sleep before exam day
- Review key vocabulary and structures
- Positive visualization

DURING EXAM:
- Read instructions carefully
- Skip difficult items, return later
- Breathe between sections
- Remember: Perfect isn't required (need 50 points out of 100)

MANAGING BLANKS:
- If you don't know a word, use simpler synonyms
- If you can't form perfect sentence, try simpler structure
- Partial credit is still credit
```
