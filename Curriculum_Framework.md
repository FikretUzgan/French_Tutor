## 🎯 Pedagogical Foundation

### CEFR-Companion Volume (2020) Integration

Our curriculum aligns with the **CEFR-CV 2020 framework**, which defines proficiency through:

#### **Four Language Activities**

| Activity | Definition | Our Implementation |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Reception** | Listening & Reading | Weekly reading passages (50-800 words based on level) + audio dialogues |
| **Production** | Speaking & Writing | Weekly homework (text + audio rotation), speaking scenarios with AI |
| **Interaction** | Two-way communication | AI-guided dialogue practice, real-time corrective feedback |
| **Mediation** | Summarizing, translating, explaining | B1+ students practice summarizing news, explaining concepts |

#### **Communicative Competence (Three Dimensions)**

**1. Linguistic Competence**
- Vocabulary range (target: 2,000 words by B2)
- Grammatical accuracy (correct tense, agreement)
- Phonological control (pronunciation, intonation)
- Implementation: Progressive grammar (Weeks 1→36), phonetic training from Week 1

**2. Sociolinguistic Competence**
- Register variation (formal vs informal, tu vs vous)
- Cultural awareness (French social norms, idiomatic expressions)
- Politeness conventions (appropriate formality levels)
- Implementation: Tier 1 focuses on basics; Tier 2+ adds register shifts and cultural notes

**3. Pragmatic Competence**
- Discourse management (conversation flow, turn-taking)
- Coherence strategies (using time markers, connectors)
- Flexibility & repair (handling misunderstandings)
- Implementation: Guided→Free interaction across 36 weeks

## 🏗️ The 5-Stage Scaffolding Model

Every grammar topic unfolds in 5 stages:

1. **Explain** (2-3 min)
   - AI gives clear rule + English comparison
   - Address common L1 interference

2. **Example** (1-2 min)
   - Show 5-6 contextualized examples from realistic scenarios
   - Examples progress from simple to complex

3. **Guided Practice** (3-5 min)
   - Student fills gaps; AI gives immediate feedback
   - "Yes, but watch agreement here..."

4. **Independent Use** (3-5 min)
   - Student produces original sentences
   - Lighter feedback, emphasis on effort

5. **Reflection** (1-2 min)
   - Student self-checks against criteria
   - AI reviews overall progress

## 🔁 Dynamic Content Variation Rule (AI Generation)

To avoid repetition while reinforcing the same grammar target, every topic must be revisited through **different perspectives, contexts, and examples**. The grammar focus stays constant, but the **scenario changes**.

**Rule:** Same structure, new lens.

**Implementation Guidelines:**
- Rotate contexts: personal → social → professional → public/cultural
- Rotate communicative intent: ask → explain → justify → compare → persuade
- Rotate lexical fields: daily life → travel → media → work → abstract ideas
- Keep grammar target stable; vary prompts, examples, and tasks

**Example (Subjunctive, 4-week sequence):**
- Emotions: "Je suis content que..."
- Doubt: "Je doute que..."
- Necessity: "Il faut que..."
- Regret: "Je regrette que..."

**Quality Check:**
- No repeated examples or prompts across consecutive weeks
- At least 2 new vocabulary items per new context
- Tasks must reflect the new scenario while preserving the same target structure

## 📊 Three-Tier Interaction Progression

### **Tier 1: Teacher-Guided Learning (Weeks 1-12, A1 → early A2)**

**Goal:** Pattern recognition, building foundation

**AI Behavior:**
- Explains rules explicitly
- Shows patterns with examples
- Asks closed questions (fill-in-the-blank, multiple choice)
- Provides immediate correctness feedback
- Corrects all errors

**Student Behavior:**
- Recognizes patterns
- Applies rules in structured exercises
- Responds to AI prompts only (not initiating)
- Recites learned phrases

**Cognitive Load:** LOW (memory, pattern recognition)

**Example:**
AI: "Je parle français [I speak French]. Tu parles français [You speak French].
Now fill: He ____ French. Choose: (a) parle (b) parles (c) parlent"

Student: "a"

AI: "Correct! 'Il' is 3rd person singular, so it uses 'parle'. You see the pattern?"

**AI Tone:** Encouraging, explicit instruction, praise for correct patterns

---

### **Tier 2: Semi-Guided Practice (Weeks 13-24, mid-A2 → B1)**

**Goal:** Meaningful production with scaffolding

**AI Behavior:**
- Suggests prompts/constraints, but student decides content
- Asks open-ended follow-up questions
- Provides gentle correction (not all errors)
- Treats student more like a learner with ideas
- Responds conversationally

**Student Behavior:**
- Initiates within structured scenarios
- Produces longer responses (5-10 sentences)
- Makes attempts; approximations are OK
- Participates in dialogue (2-3 exchanges)

**Cognitive Load:** MEDIUM (production, problem-solving)

**Example:**
AI: "You want to book a hotel room. What will you ask me?
You know 'Je voudrais...' [I would like] and 'Tu as...?' [Do you have...?]"

Student: "Je voudrais une chambre avec balcon."

AI: "Good! You're thinking in French. Try making it a question:
'Avez-vous une chambre avec balcon?' (using vous because it's formal)"

Student: "Avez-vous une chambre avec balcon?"

AI: "Parfait! Now ask about the price..."

**AI Tone:** Encouraging, collaborative, light correction

---

### **Tier 3: Free Production (Weeks 25-36, B1.2 → B2.2)**

**Goal:** Fluent, nuanced communication

**AI Behavior:**
- Acts as conversation peer (not obviously teacher)
- Asks challenging follow-up questions
- Corrects only register/nuance issues
- Can be gently challenged by student
- Uses authentic conversational patterns

**Student Behavior:**
- Drives conversation topic
- Produces at length (1-3 minute stretches)
- Debates, questions, disagrees
- Manages conversation flow

**Cognitive Load:** HIGH (reasoning, argumentation, social awareness)

**Example:**
AI: "Qu'en penses-tu du changement climatique?"

Student: "C'est très important, mais je pense que les gouvernements ne font pas assez."

AI: "OK, pourquoi? Donne-moi un exemple concret."

Student: "Parce que les émissions de CO2 augmentent toujours et..."

AI: "Oui. Mais attention: le gouvernement est singulier, donc c'est 'le gouvernement augmente',
pas 'augmentent'. Autrement, c'est une bonne observation. Pourc­ontinuer..."


**AI Tone:** Like a peer; corrects for learning, not perfectionism

| 13-16 | 4 | A2.2 | **1→2** | Students start producing original content |
| 17-24 | 5-6 | A2.2-B1 | 2 | Semi-guided; AI asks open questions |
| 25-28 | 7 | B2.1 | **2→3** | Student initiates; AI debates |

## 🎓 Assessment & Progress Tracking

### **Weekly Exams (Every Sunday)**

- **Type:** Formative (checks understanding)
- **Content:** Grammar (10 questions), Vocabulary (15 words), Reading (100-500 words + 5 questions), Speaking (1 scenario, 1-2 minutes)
- **Scoring:** 70% = pass (must get 70% grammar + vocab, 60% reading/speaking)
- **Feedback:** Immediate, specific to error type

### **Level Exams (Weeks 9, 18, 27, 36)**

- **Type:** Summative (evaluates full level competency)
- **Duration:** 90-120 minutes
- **Sections:** Grammar (30-40 min), Vocabulary (15-20 min), Reading (20-30 min), Writing (15-20 min), Speaking (10-15 min)
- **Scoring:** 75% overall = advance (70% on all critical topics)
- **Failure Protocol:** 1 week remedial lessons + retake (different questions)

### **Weak Topic Diagnosis**

After each weekly exam, AI identifies:
- Topics with <70% accuracy
- Specific error patterns ("Subjonctif triggers: 40% accuracy" → remedial lesson)
- Recommended review

## 🎯 Quality Principles

1. **Coherence:** Topics build logically; no isolated grammar points
2. **Authenticity:** Scenarios are real-world; vocabulary from actual usage
3. **Comprehensibility:** Input is "comprehensible+" (above current level, but understandable with context)
4. **Engagement:** AI is encouraging; feedback praises effort, not perfection
5. **Assessment Clarity:** Every score has a rubric; student knows what success looks like

**Implementation:** This framework guides the creation of DETAILED_WEEKLY_PLANS.md (Weeks 1-36 specifications) and INTERACTION_PROGRESSION_MODEL.md (detailed tier mechanics).
