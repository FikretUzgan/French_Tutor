## Best Practices for Structuring Different Exercise Types

### FILL-IN-THE-BLANK Exercises
**Best Practice:** Always include base verb/form in parentheses
- ✅ "Elle _____ (avoir) un chat"
- ❌ "Elle _____ un chat"

**Why:** Shows student *what* to conjugate without revealing answer

**Complexity Levels:**
- **A1:** Simple present, clear context: "Je _____ (être) français"
- **A2:** Past/future tenses, pronoun variety: "Nous _____ (finir) le projet hier"

**Avoid:** Ambiguous blanks; blank placement should be strategic

---

### LISTENING EXERCISES
**Best Practice:** Multi-pass listening progression

1. **First listen:** Identify main idea / gist ("What's the conversation about?")
2. **Second listen:** Answer specific detail questions ("Who? What? Where?")
3. **Third listen (A2+):** Make inference or summarize ("Why did they decide that?")

**Content Duration:**
- Dialogues: 50-100 seconds
- Announcements: 30-60 seconds
- Monologues: 60-120 seconds

**Question Mix:**
- Factual (50%) - "What time?"
- Inferential (30%) - "Why?"
- Evaluative (20%) - "What's the tone?"

---

### DIALOGUE/ROLE-PLAY EXERCISES

**Tier 1 (A1):** AI prompts + fixed vocabulary response
- AI: "Bonjour! Comment ça va?"
- Student: Selects from 3-4 phrases: ["Ça va bien", "Pas mal", "Très bien"]
- Purpose: Pattern recognition & repetition

**Tier 2 (A2):** AI provides context/constraint + student semi-improvises
- AI: "You're at a café. Order a coffee and pastry."
- Student: Speaks freely but within restaurant context
- Purpose: Production with guidance

**Tier 3 (B1+):** Minimal guidance + student drives conversation
- AI: "Let's chat about your favorite hobby. Go ahead!"
- Student: Initiates & maintains conversation
- Purpose: Natural conversation practice

**Content Per Session:** 3-5 exchanges typical

---

### READING COMPREHENSION

**Passage Length:**
- **A1:** 50-100 words
- **A2:** 150-250 words
- **B1+:** 300-500 words

**Question Types (by percentage):**
- Factual (50%): "Who did what?" / Direct information from text
- Inference (30%): "Why?" / Requires logical deduction
- Vocabulary (20%): "What does X mean?" / Context clues

**Question Count:**
- **A1:** 3-5 questions
- **A2:** 5-8 questions
- **B1+:** 8-12 questions

---

### TRANSLATION EXERCISES

**A1 Level:**
- Word-to-word (single words) only
- Simple phrases: "Hello" → "Bonjour"

**A2 Level:**
- Short sentences (1-2 clauses)
- Maintain register: "Can you help me?" → "Peux-tu m'aider?"

**Assessment Tip:** Accept multiple correct translations
- "Je suis heureux" = "I am happy" OR "I am content" (both acceptable)

---

### CONJUGATION EXERCISES

**Structure:**
- Show infinitive in parentheses: "Je _____ (être)"
- Show subject pronoun clearly: "Nous"
- Show tense requirement clearly: "Tu _____ (aller) demain" vs "Tu _____ (aller) hier"

**Difficulty Progression:**
- **Level 1:** Regular verbs, present tense only
- **Level 2:** Irregular verbs, present tense
- **Level 3:** Regular + irregular, past + future mixed
- **Level 4:** Complex tenses (subjonctif, conditionnel)

---

### ERROR DETECTION EXERCISES

**Types:**

1. **Grammar Errors:** "Je suis allé à Paris hier" (correct verb use) vs. "Je vais aller à Paris hier" (tense mismatch)
2. **Spelling Errors:** "Je suis heureux" vs. "Je suis heureux" (accent marks)
3. **Punctuation Errors:** Missing apostrophes in contractions: "Le cafe" vs. "L'café"
4. **Agreement Errors:** Gender/number mismatch: "Le filles" vs. "Les filles"
5. **Word Order Errors:** "Je vais très à l'école" vs. "Je vais à l'école très bien"
