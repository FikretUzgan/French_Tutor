# Learning App Analysis: Duolingo, Busuu, Babbel

## A. DUOLINGO

### Content Structure (Observable)
- **Lesson Format:** Micro-lessons (2-5 minutes) grouped in "skill trees"
- **Daily Lessons:** 5-15 exercises per session
- **Grammar Approach:** Implicit learning (grammar emerges through examples, minimal explicit rules)
- **Exercise Types:** Image matching, word ordering, listen & select, translate, multiple choice
- **Progression:** Interleaved spiral approach (vocabulary revisited with new grammar contexts)

### Unique Features
- Gamification (streaks, XP points, leagues)
- Spaced repetition built into algorithm (easy items reappear less frequently)
- Listening emphasized equally to reading/writing
- Speaking element: limited (read-aloud exercises, not conversation)
- No formal grammar tables or conjugation lists upfront

### A1-A2 Structure
- Beginner section (~40-50 lessons) covers: greetings, present tense regular verbs, basic questions, daily routines, food, family
- Fast progression to past tense (around lesson 20-25)
- Limited emphasis on gender/agreement rules (implicit learning)
